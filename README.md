## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based keylogger developed as part of Task 4 of my SkillCraft Technology internship. It records all keyboard inputs on a system, storing them securely in a log file. This tool is designed to demonstrate the fundamentals of keylogging techniques often studied in the context of ethical hacking and system security analysis.

## Features

- Captures and records every key press
- Logs saved locally in a `.txt` file
- Runs silently in the background
- Easy to start and stop
- Cross-platform compatible with `pynput` library

## Learning Outcomes

- Understood how keylogging works at the OS-level
- Learned to use the `pynput` library to monitor keyboard events
- Practiced secure file handling and logging
- Gained insights into real-world applications of keyloggers in cybersecurity (e.g., penetration testing, forensic analysis)
- Reinforced ethical boundaries and legal considerations of such tools
